# Email - Spammer
What is the Email - Spammer
  It's does what it says, it's an email spammer

How does it work.
    Well you could read the src code but. I'll tell you.
    What it does is use the SMTPLib (A python module) to connect to any smtp server.
    The GUI is made in the Tkinter module.

How to use it, well it's simple

1. Setup the servers, just search your email service + smtp then find the smtp port
2. Setup the email, just type your email, then password.
3. Open the spammer.
